            <h3>Two Paragraphs</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a paragraph. This paragraph is about nothing. 
                    I am just writing it to have a paragraph on this website. 
                    I just learned that the browser ignores extra spaces and lines. 
                    That is convenient for code formatting. Otherwise there would just 
                    be one long line. I would not bother to continue reading this 
                    paragraph. It is not worth it. This paragraph is about nothing. 
                    I guess the paragraph is almost long enough now. I will just make 
                    it a little bit longer though. I'm surprised if you're still reading this.
                    I guess I am done writing this paragraph. I hope you enjoyed it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is another paragraph. I just felt like the page needed another one, 
                    so here it is. If you read the first paragraph, I have no idea why you 
                    would spend time reading this one. There is no useful information 
                    in this paragraph. The soul purpose of this paragraph is to make 
                    the webpage more visually pleasing. I might add another paragraph 
                    after this, but I will put a different header. I feel like this 
                    paragraph needs to be longer. I am making this paragraph longer.
                    I know this is not required. In fact, I should not be spending time
                    writing this. However, it bothers me that the webpage looks so basic. 
                    Therefore, I must add more content to this page. I also realize that
                    the colors are not required, but I thought it looked too boring in 
                    just black and white. I got the color scheme from 
                    <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/?utm_expid=.GAUOy8V1TSaMuxs_H3GVCQ.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">Canva.com</a>.
                    This color scheme is called <i>Maritime Brights</i> and is number 67 in 
                    the listing. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I am going to add one more paragraph. However, 
                    it will just be the first paragraph again. If you are still 
                    reading this, I am impressed. After I add this paragraph, I 
                    am going to attempt to deploy this website using Heroku. 
                </p>
            
            <h3>The First Paragraph Again</h3>
